                    In the modern era of fierce competition and business rivalry, having complete know how about the customers
                     is essential for any organization to reduce the gap between marketing and sales effectiveness. Customer
                      data base if maintained effectively not only helps an organization to be in touch
                     with the customers but also helps in updating the customers on the latest offers, products and services.</p>

                     <p className="content font-resp">Even a slight gap in the contact data is enough to bring a downward slide in the leads
                      and sales in your current business. For this, restricting only with data verification is not adequate,
                      organization needs to enhance or upgrade it by cleansing the current data base with erroneous and outdated data.</p>
