                    Use email to locate name and address Business to Business Your existing email addresses database
                     will be used to provide additional information about the individuals who own these email addresses
                      – allowing you to further segment, target and contact them by additional means. Reverse Append takes
                       advantage of the fact that for many online marketers, the email address is the only identifier within 
                       their online database. To find postal addresses, Reverse Append matches your email-only file with the
                        Smart Business contacts database of over 900 million records that include email addresses as well as
                         name and postal address. Where an email address matches,
                     Reverse Append will return a file containing the name and deliverable postal address of the individual at the given email address.</p>
