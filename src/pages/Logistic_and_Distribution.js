                            <FaCheckCircle /> Over the past few years, companies in the distribution and logistics
                             industry are under constant pressure to meet greater customer expectations, improve

                              is triggered further by factors such as fluctuations in fuel prices, trade regulations,
                               and performance of the overall economy.

                            possible. Strategic partnerships with individual truckers are the key 
                            to success of this strategy, which in turns makes supplier relationship 
                            management more crucial. Logistics providers should also look at social 
                            media and mobile deployment to build a community comprising of key stakeholders of the business.
