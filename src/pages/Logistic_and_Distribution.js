                            <FaCheckCircle /> Over the past few years, companies in the distribution and logistics
                             industry are under constant pressure to meet greater customer expectations, improve 
                             return on assets, minimize operating costs, and promote operational excellence. This
                              is triggered further by factors such as fluctuations in fuel prices, trade regulations,
                               and performance of the overall economy.

                            <FaCheckCircle /> A growing number of logistics service providers are 
                            leveraging mobility, telemetry, and analytics to drive operational
                             excellence. It is a common strategy to develop a 360 degree view of 
                             performance which gives you an insight to improve the decision making process.

                            <FaCheckCircle /> Logistics service providers follow an "asset-light" 
                            supply chain strategy where they own as few warehouses and trucks as 
                            possible. Strategic partnerships with individual truckers are the key 
                            to success of this strategy, which in turns makes supplier relationship 
                            management more crucial. Logistics providers should also look at social 
                            media and mobile deployment to build a community comprising of key stakeholders of the business.
